# 05-Work-Day-Scheduler
Homework assignment #5 for CWRU Coding Boot Camp

The assignment was to make a day planner application for a 9-5 worker. This planner would feature dynamic color changes based on hours of the day as well as a way to input and save tasks based on the time of day. When the save button is clicked, value of the field is stored in local storage so that the information persists on refresh. Clear button at bottom of page clears out all previously stored information.
